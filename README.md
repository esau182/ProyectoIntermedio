# VoxTranslate
# Overview
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This guide explains how to set up and deploy the project on a local machine or a hosting platform.

This project is a powerful voice transcription and translation web application designed to make language translation accessible and efficient. Using cutting-edge technology, it captures spoken words through the microphone, transcribes them into text, and provides a real-time translation.

# Features

Voice Transcription: Converts spoken language into text accurately in real time using the browserâ€™s built-in speech recognition capabilities.

Language Translation: Provides instant translation of transcribed text, making it easy for users to understand or communicate in different languages.

User Authentication: Secured login and registration features to protect user data, with token-based authentication for enhanced security.

Secure Data Storage: Utilizes MongoDB for efficient data management, and bcrypt for secure password storage.
